I am from Beijing, China. I went through high school in Vancouver before and came to Toronto as an undergraduate. Currently studying for a master's degree in Statistics at the University of Toronto. At present, what I mainly want to learn is data analysis, so I also want to move in this direction in terms of future work.

As a student of Statistics, I have gained a deep understanding of statistical methods and techniques, including regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning algorithms. In addition to my coursework, I have also gained practical experience in data analysis through various research projects and internships.

My passion for data analysis has led me to explore various fields where I can apply my skills and knowledge. I am particularly interested in working in industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology, where data analysis plays a crucial role in decision-making processes. I am excited about the prospect of working on projects that require me to develop and apply statistical models to real-world data, and to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to find innovative solutions to complex problems.

Moreover, I have also been developing my programming skills, particularly in languages such as R and Python. These programming languages have become an integral part of modern data analysis, and I believe that mastering them will enhance my ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effectively. In addition, I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques that can help me improve my data analysis skills.

Overall, I am confident that my background in statistics, coupled with my passion for data analysis and programming, makes me a strong candidate for a career in data analysis. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to solve challenging data-driven problems.
